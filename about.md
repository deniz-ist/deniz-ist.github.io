## Hi! Read below if you want to get to know me better.

### Who am I?

I'm a senior year linguistics student from Bogazici University. I was born and raised in Istanbul. I'm a music enthusiast and I love to listen to different artists from different countries, cultures and genres. I am also a big sports person and I'm part of our university team of Track & Field.

### Why am I applying to this program?

Ever since starting my major, I wanted to work in tech. I took some Python and R classes, as well as a computational linguistics course, but I never had the hands-on experience opportunity during them and I felt like I wasn't learning enough, so I gradually lost interest. I'm hoping this opportunity will help me a lot with finding my passion again and becoming competent in the field.
