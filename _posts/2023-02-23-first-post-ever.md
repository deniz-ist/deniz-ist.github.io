The process of learning how to design my first website has been fun. And I mean **real** fun!    
I'll try to explain the steps that I followed to design this *really awesome website*

1. First, we had to create a github account. Fortunately, I already had one so I skipped this step. Deniz 1, website 0 :)
2. Secondly, I had to fork and work on a repository called *jekyll-blog-template*:
    - I first forked the template and added it to my repository.
    - Then, I renamed and customized the repo and **bam**, I had my website ready to go!
    - And of course at the end, I expressed my gratitude to the original creator.
3. After all this, it was time to further customize the website so that it reflected me:
    - First order of business, I changed my website's heading, subheading and banner.
    - Then, I customized the auto translate menu so that it also translated my site to Turkish and Spanish!
    - Thirdly, I uploaded a new banner image and changed the previous one to make it look as cool as it does now.
    - Lastly, I edited the *"about"* page to let you know more about me.
4. And the last step was to create my first post, which you've been reading so far. Hope you had fun!
